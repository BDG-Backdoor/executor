# Offline AI System for Roblox Executor

## Overview

This directory contains resources and configuration for the fully offline AI system integrated into the Roblox Executor. The AI system provides:

1. Comprehensive vulnerability detection in Roblox scripts
2. Script generation from natural language descriptions
3. Self-improving capabilities through usage patterns

## Key Features

### 100% Offline Operation
- All models run locally on device
- No cloud/server dependencies
- Complete privacy for your scripts and usage patterns

### Thorough Vulnerability Detection
- Identifies script injection vulnerabilities
- Detects remote event exploits
- Finds HTTP service misuse
- Discovers data store manipulation issues
- Reveals access control weaknesses
- And many more vulnerability types

### Intelligent Script Generation
- Create scripts from simple descriptions
- Supports movement, visual, automation scripts
- Customizes based on game types
- Learns from your preferences

### Self-Improvement
- System improves as you use it
- Learns from feedback on detections and generated scripts
- Adapts to different Roblox games
- Updates vulnerability detection patterns automatically

## Usage

The AI system is fully integrated into the Executor. When you:

1. **Scan scripts for vulnerabilities** - The AI will identify all potential security issues
2. **Generate scripts** - Type a description of what you want to create
3. **Provide feedback** - Rating scripts and correcting false detections helps the system learn

## Data Storage

All AI data is stored locally on your device in the application's data directory. No data is sent to external servers.

## Documentation

For more detailed documentation about the AI system:

1. Comprehensive overview: `docs/AI_OFFLINE_SYSTEM.md`
2. User guide: `docs/USER_AI_GUIDE.md`
3. Integration details: `docs/AI_INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md`

## Configuration

The `config.json` file in this directory contains settings for the AI system. Most settings are automatically optimized, but advanced users can modify them to:

- Adjust detection sensitivity
- Configure training priorities
- Set model parameters
- Customize fallback behavior

## Feedback

As you use the AI features, the system automatically improves. For best results:
- Review scripts before executing them
- Correct any false positive vulnerability detections
- Modify generated scripts to better match your needs

The system will learn from these interactions to better serve you in the future, all while keeping your data local and private.
