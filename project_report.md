# Roblox Executor Codebase Improvement Report

## Overview
This report summarizes the changes made to improve the Roblox Executor codebase and make it production-ready by removing all stub implementations, standardizing the build system, and fixing Lua/Luau integration issues.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Removed Stub Implementations
- Eliminated all CI stub implementations across the codebase
- Replaced stub code with functional implementations, including:
  - Hook implementations using Dobby
  - GameDetector implementation
  - Pattern scanner implementation
  - AI feature stubs (SignatureAdaptation, OnlineService)

### 2. Standardized Build System
- Created a consistent build workflow that works on both CI and local environments
- Removed multiple competing GitHub workflow files
- Updated CMakeLists.txt to use real implementations instead of stubs
- Created a streamlined build script (build_dylib.sh) for local development

### 3. Fixed Lua/Luau Integration
- Standardized the approach to Lua/Luau integration
- Fixed compatibility issues between LuaFileSystem and the main Lua implementation
- Created proper implementation of lua_wrapper to integrate with real Lua VM
- Applied necessary compatibility fixes to enable proper function calls

### 4. Removed CI_BUILD Conditionals
- Eliminated all CI_BUILD preprocessor conditionals
- Ensured consistent code paths on all platforms
- Fixed ci_config.h to always use the real implementation

## Files Modified
- source/cpp/hooks/hooks.hpp - Removed stub implementations
- source/cpp/ci_config.h - Removed CI conditionals
- source/cpp/CMakeLists.txt - Use real implementation instead of stubs
- source/cpp/ios/GameDetector.h - Updated to use real implementation
- source/cpp/ios/PatternScanner.h - Fixed stub implementation
- source/cpp/ios/ai_features/* - Fixed AI implementation stubs
- source/lua_wrapper.c - Updated to use real implementations

## Files Removed
- source/cpp/ios/GameDetector_CI.cpp - Removed unnecessary CI stub file
- Multiple competing CI workflow files - Standardized on a single approach

## Build System Improvements
1. Created a comprehensive build script that:
   - Automatically downloads and builds Dobby if needed
   - Applies Lua compatibility fixes
   - Builds the dylib with real implementations
   - Produces a ready-to-use output in the output/ directory

2. Standardized the GitHub workflow to:
   - Use a consistent approach for CI builds
   - Build with real implementations on CI
   - Produce verified working artifacts

## Conclusion
The codebase has been successfully updated to production quality by removing all stub implementations and ensuring proper integration of all components. The build system has been standardized, and the code now consistently uses real implementations instead of stubs.
