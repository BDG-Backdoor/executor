# Executor AI System: User Guide

## What's New: Enhanced Offline AI System

Our executor now includes a fully offline AI system with advanced capabilities:

- **100% Local Processing** - All AI features now work without internet connection
- **Advanced Vulnerability Detection** - Identifies ALL types of security issues in scripts
- **Improved Script Generation** - Creates optimized scripts based on natural language
- **Self-Learning Capabilities** - System automatically improves based on your usage

## What the AI Can Do For You

Our powerful AI system helps you in multiple ways:

### 1. Script Creation & Help

**The AI can:**
- Generate complete scripts from simple descriptions
- Explain how complex scripts work
- Convert your ideas into working Lua code
- Provide examples for specific game mechanics

**Examples of what to ask:**
- "Create an ESP script that shows player health"
- "Write a script that teleports me to nearest coin"
- "How do I make a speed hack that works in this game?"
- "Explain how this script works"

### 2. Vulnerability Detection & Security

**The NEW AI security scanner can detect:**
- Script injection vulnerabilities (`loadstring`, `setfenv`)
- Remote event exploits and misuse
- Insecure HTTP requests
- Data store manipulation issues
- Weak authentication and validation
- Obfuscated code execution attempts
- And many more security issues

**How to use:**
1. Load your script in the editor
2. Click "Scan for Vulnerabilities" 
3. Review the highlighted issues with severity ratings
4. Apply suggested fixes or mark false positives

### 3. Script Debugging & Optimization

**The AI can:**
- Find errors in your scripts
- Suggest fixes for broken code
- Optimize scripts for better performance
- Explain why something isn't working

**Examples of what to ask:**
- "Debug this script for me"
- "Why is my teleport script not working?"
- "Make this script more efficient"
- "Fix the errors in this code"

### 4. Game Analysis

**The AI can:**
- Analyze game mechanics
- Suggest useful scripts for the current game
- Identify important game functions
- Provide game-specific advice

**Examples of what to ask:**
- "What scripts would be useful in this game?"
- "How do I access the coins in this game?"
- "What are the important parts of this game to script?"
- "Analyze this game's structure"

### 5. Protection & Self-Improvement

**The AI automatically:**
- Adapts to anti-cheat updates
- Creates new protection strategies
- Learns from detection attempts
- Improves vulnerability detection over time
- Enhances script generation based on your feedback

## How to Use the AI

### Using the AI Assistant Button

1. In the script editor, tap the "AI Help" button
2. Type your question or request
3. The AI will respond with helpful information or code
4. Tap "Use This Code" to insert scripts directly into the editor

### Using the NEW Vulnerability Scanner

1. Write or paste a script in the editor
2. Click the "Scan Vulnerabilities" button in the toolbar
3. Review the highlighted issues categorized by severity:
   - Red: Critical security issues
   - Orange: High severity concerns
   - Yellow: Medium severity issues
   - Blue: Low severity concerns
4. Hover over any highlighted code to see the detailed issue description
5. Click "Apply Fix" to automatically fix an issue, or "Ignore" to mark a false positive

### Using the AI Debug Feature

1. Write or paste a script in the editor
2. Tap the "Debug with AI" button
3. The AI will analyze your script and show any problems
4. Follow the suggestions to fix issues

### Using the Enhanced Script Generator

1. Tap "Create New Script"
2. Select "Generate with AI"
3. Describe what you want the script to do
4. Optionally specify:
   - Game type (Simulator, FPS, etc.)
   - Script context (server-side or client-side)
   - Special requirements (memory efficiency, anti-detection, etc.)
5. The AI will create a complete script based on your description
6. Edit as needed or use directly
7. Rate the generated script to help the AI improve

## Tips for Best Results

1. **Be Specific**: "Create an ESP script that shows player names and health bars" works better than "Make an ESP"

2. **Provide Context**: Mention the game you're scripting for if applicable

3. **Ask for Explanations**: If you don't understand something, ask the AI to explain it

4. **Iterate**: If the first result isn't perfect, ask the AI to modify specific parts

5. **Provide Feedback**: Rate generated scripts and correct vulnerability detection to improve the AI

6. **Explore Advanced Features**: Try the vulnerability scanner on existing scripts to find security issues

## Privacy and Security

The new AI system is designed with complete privacy:

- **100% Offline Operation**: All processing happens on your device
- **No Data Collection**: Your scripts and usage patterns never leave your device
- **No Internet Required**: All features work without internet connection
- **Secure Storage**: AI data is stored securely within the app's sandbox

## Example Conversations

### Example 1: Script Generation

**User:** "I want to create a script that makes all players visible through walls with different colors for teammates and enemies"

**AI:** "Here's an ESP script that shows players through walls with team colors:

```lua
-- Player ESP with Team Colors
local players = game:GetService("Players")
local localPlayer = players.LocalPlayer
local camera = workspace.CurrentCamera

-- Create ESP highlights
local function createESP()
    for _, player in pairs(players:GetPlayers()) do
        if player ~= localPlayer and player.Character then
            -- Create highlight
            local highlight = Instance.new("Highlight")
            highlight.FillColor = player.Team == localPlayer.Team 
                and Color3.fromRGB(0, 255, 0)  -- Green for teammates
                or Color3.fromRGB(255, 0, 0)   -- Red for enemies
            highlight.OutlineColor = Color3.new(1, 1, 1)
            highlight.FillTransparency = 0.5
            highlight.OutlineTransparency = 0
            highlight.Parent = player.Character
            
            -- Add name label
            local billboardGui = Instance.new("BillboardGui")
            billboardGui.Size = UDim2.new(0, 100, 0, 40)
            billboardGui.AlwaysOnTop = true
            billboardGui.Parent = player.Character.Head
            
            local nameLabel = Instance.new("TextLabel")
            nameLabel.Size = UDim2.new(1, 0, 1, 0)
            nameLabel.BackgroundTransparency = 1
            nameLabel.TextColor3 = highlight.FillColor
            nameLabel.TextStrokeTransparency = 0
            nameLabel.Text = player.Name
            nameLabel.Parent = billboardGui
        end
    end
end

-- Run ESP function
createESP()

-- Update ESP when players are added
players.PlayerAdded:Connect(function(player)
    player.CharacterAdded:Connect(function()
        wait(1) -- Wait for character to load
        createESP()
    end)
end)
```

Would you like me to explain how this script works or modify it in any way?"

### Example 2: Vulnerability Detection

**User:** *Loads a script with security issues and clicks "Scan Vulnerabilities"*

**AI:** "I've detected the following security issues:

1. **Critical**: Script injection vulnerability (Line 12)
   ```lua
   local func = loadstring(userInput)
   ```
   This allows execution of user-provided code which is very dangerous.
   Suggested fix: Validate user input with a whitelist or use a safer alternative.

2. **High**: Remote event exploitation (Line 24)
   ```lua
   RemoteEvent:FireServer(_G.playerData)
   ```
   Sending global variables to the server could allow data manipulation.
   Suggested fix: Only send specific validated data instead of entire global tables.

3. **Medium**: Insecure HTTP request (Line 36)
   ```lua
   local response = HttpService:GetAsync("http://example.com/data?user="..player.Name)
   ```
   Sending player data to external servers via HTTP.
   Suggested fix: Avoid sending identifying information, use HTTPS, and validate servers.

Would you like me to automatically fix these issues?"
