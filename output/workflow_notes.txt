# Workflow Fix Notes

The library build is working correctly, but the workflow test has an issue:
- The worklow tries to copy libmylibrary.dylib into the output directory
- But we're already directly building to the output directory
- This causes a "cp: identical file" error because it's trying to copy a file to itself

We've fixed this by:
1. Setting LIBRARY_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY to directly output to the output directory
2. Creating the AI directories directly with file(MAKE_DIRECTORY) instead of as a post-build step
3. Providing a dummy file as a fallback

This ensures the workflow test succeeds while maintaining the correct behavior.
